/* ### Other information and guidelines:
 *
 * - Use the node version specified by the engines property in package.json.
 *
 * - `url` should include the protocol and domain, which would be www.cnn.com.
 *
 * - Not all articles will have an image.  If an article has something like a
 *   gallery or a video, use your best judgement.
 *
 * - The `imageUrl` should reference the highest quality image available.
 *
 * - The `byLine` should contain information about the author of the article,
 *   which may not be available for every article.
 *
 * - The source feed will represent what is on the top of the www.cnn.com
 *   homepage.  The content to map is in a _container_ with a _title_ of
 *   "Top stories".  This content changes all the time.  The placement of
 *   this container will change as well.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * ## Task 2 (of 2)
 *
 * Configure the project to execute ESLint on all JavaScript files in the
 * project using the included .eslintrc configuration when `npm test` is run.
 * DO NOT use Grunt or Gulp.  The test should pass.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * ## Extra Credit
 *
 * Write a unit test to validate that the JSON ouput is valid and matches the
 * expected schema.
